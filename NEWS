CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.01 (2012-05-31)

  o removed absolute scale matrices from run.profiling.script
    output. The idea is that just one log10 file for each phylogenetic
    level is outputted, and the user can then use other reading/analysis
    routines to read the data, convert to original non-log domain if
    necessary, etc. This is to provide a unique output format to avoid mistakes.
  o save.data and tree.display removed from run.profiling.script arguments
  o combined get.phylogeny and get.phylogeny.MITChip
  o moved plotting functions from run.profiling.script into a separate
    function profiling.hclust;

    "/tmp.RData", sep = "")) to enable the use of data from the current
    workspace during a session
  o multcomp replaced by parallel in dependencies
  o Removed "Use existing data from the workspace" (useDB) option. Problems when called from within a function. More clear and modular when
    the run.profiling.script is used for preprocessing, and any new plots are performed as separate steps based on the profiling output files if needed.
  o Moved run.profiling.script plots to their own functions and added usage examples to vignette.
